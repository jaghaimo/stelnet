# Stellar Networks

Stellar Networks is a QoL oriented Starsector mod.
It adds three new intel tabs: Commodity, Market, and Storage.
Each tab comes with interactive boards that are used to manage presented intel.

## Available Boards

### Contacts

Contacts board presents a filterable (by priority, by type) list of all your active contacts.
Using the board you can quickly navigate to see each contact's intel details, or directly call the person.
All items and ships acquired during the call will be deposited to the Storage of the respective market.

### Commodity

Commodity board (formerly [Galactic Markets](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19383)) is used to display buying and selling prices among all known markets.

#### Profit
Commodity board also hosts a Profit tab which can be used to find viable trade routes. Filters by most profitable routes in descending order and displays only routes where potential profit margin is over 100000 credits. When the route is within the same system, highlights the sector total distance colour in yellow.

### Market

Queries board (formerly [Hyperspace Networks](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19252)) manages market searches.
These can be either staff search (e.g. freelance administrator, steady officer, aggressive mercenary), item search (e.g. specific mod-spec or weapon), or ship search (e.g. pristine frigate, d-modded carrier).
