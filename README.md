# Stellar Networks

Stellar Networks is a pure-information oriented Starsector mod. It adds three
new intel tabs: Commodity, Market, and Storage. Each tab comes with its own
interactive board that can be used to manage presented intel.

## Available Boards

### Commodity

Commodity board (formerly [Galactic Markets](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19383))
is used to display buying and selling prices among all known markets. It also
hosts a Profit tab that can be used to find viable trade routes.

### Market

Market board (formerly [Hyperspace Networks](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=19252))
manages market searches. These can be either staff search (e.g. freelance
administrator, steady officer, aggressive mercenary), item search (e.g. specific
mod-spec or weapon), or ship search (e.g. pristine frigate, d-modded carrier).

### Storage

Storage board (formerly [Stellar Logistics](https://fractalsoftworks.com/forum/index.php?topic=18948))
displays all cargo and ships stored among all Storages. It allows to display
a unified view to quickly verify what is available, and per-location view to
find out where.
